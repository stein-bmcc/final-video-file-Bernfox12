            To make my animation project I had in mind to create a space scene where we are in view of the earth turning and that has the moon to turn it. I had made this sense using  Clipchamp, Adobe after effects, Adobe Illustrator. First i when to adobe illustrator to create the props for my animation. Before I was originally going to make a cat and a dog meowing and marking but I wasn't fully used to the adobe after effect materials and decided to change it into something else I liked which turned out to be space. I wanted to create a pretty scenery that would give of the vibe of magical. At first after completing the full thing I had realized that I put the color setting wrong and had to reput the work on another thing because the colors looked dull.

                First started with creating the background by using the square tool and using the colors blue, black and purple. I got the colors to fade into each other due to the color option where we can put where each color is coming from, like placing a lighting. Then I would use the star tools to make the stars, the circle tool to make the earth, moon and meteor. While for the rest of the design I made it with the pen tool. For the animation part I use adobe after effect using  the 3 animation things we learn about. That being rotation, where I made the stars, earth and the grass rotate to give the effect of making it look like it's spinning. That also being positioned to move around the moon to make it loop around the earth and to make the meteor pass by. Last opacity where I use it to give the illusion of one moon looping around  when there are actually 2 that's moving. To give my work the magical effect it is that I wanted to add sound into it. I wanted to use something where it sounds like it comes from a game, i did this by borrowing audio and putting  them into clipchamp.
